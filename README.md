### To do
* Each webpage needs:
  * A Wireframe
  * Content( Examples: Slogan, Quotes, Description, Comments )
  * ~Responsiveness~
* All pages will make use of the same:
  * Color Scheme
  * Sitemap
  * Page Navigation
  * ~Icons( Examples: Navigation Buttons, Loading Screens, etc )~
  
> You could add more such as background images, etc but for now this is just the basic/standard layout workflow if everyone agrees
